[Apple iPhone Prediction in 2007](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aRelVKWbMAv0)

[This](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aRelVKWbMAv0) article has been sitting on my Instapaper for nearly 2 months now, I just got a chance to read it and was amazed at it.

To give you a quick insight on the article:

> The iPhone is nothing more than a luxury bauble that will appeal to a few gadget freaks. In terms of its impact on the industry, the iPhone is less relevant.

>

> Apple will sell a few to its fans, but the iPhone won't make a long-term mark on the industry.

Matthew Lynn, the author of this article could not be more wrong.

A quick overview of Apple's numbers shows just how wrong the prediction was:

**262 **iPhones sold per minute
**109** iPads sold per minute**
365 Million** iOS devices sold

**30%** of the US population have an iPhone
**18,000** people visit Apple Store each week
**$1598.32** is made in profit each second

Just to put things into perspective, more iPhones are being sold than people being born everyday.

**Source**: Numbers are from [SEC Filings](http://investor.apple.com/sec.cfm) on Apple's website and [Apple by the Numbers](http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2012/04/apple-by-the-numbers/) by Barry Ritholtz.
