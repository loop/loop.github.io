[TotalFinder - Finder On Steroids](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com)

As much as I love Finder I just find navigating multiple windows of Finder really cumbersome. I found TotalFinder which is pretty sweet, it isn't an additional app, it extends Finder. It basically turns Finder into The Hulk and CPU usage is same as Finder which is a big plus. There are many alternative Finders but this one is the best one out there and for a lovely price!
