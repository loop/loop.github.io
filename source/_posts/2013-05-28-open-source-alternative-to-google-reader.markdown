Google Reader shutting down 1st July
Why Google Reader was the best choice; able to continue where you left off and cross-device compatiability
Best open source and free alterantive is ttRSS.
Ability to use Heroku and still be on the free plan without breaking the ToS.
Script avaliable so you can install this within 5 mins - https://github.com/projectdelphai/ttrss-on-heroku
Plugins I'm using
My setup from ttRSS to Pinboard like it was before on Google Reader
Apps for Android and iOS. (Reeder)
Conclusion. It is free and but Heroku could remove the free plan. I don't see this happening anytime soon and the free plan will be aviliable.
