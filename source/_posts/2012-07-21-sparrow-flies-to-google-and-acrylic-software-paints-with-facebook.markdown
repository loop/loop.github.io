Yesterday 2 amazing teams were hired by the big boys. [Sparrow](http://sparrowmailapp.com/) was acquired by Google for under [$25 Million](http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/20/3172365/sources-google-sparrow-25-million-gmail-client/in/2936538). Sparrow is the best mail client out there, it is so simple and just works. It is such a shame that the development of Sparrow will cease and no new features will be added to their mail clients. Hopefully the team and Google can work together to bring a more awesome mail client.

> We will continue to make available our existing products, and we will provide support and critical updates to our users. However, as we’ll be busy with new projects at Google, we do not plan to release new features for the Sparrow apps.

I can't say that I am surprised about this acquisition, Google's initial release of their GMail app for iOS really sucked and in my opinion still sucks.

I guess it is back to Apple Mail (which is the most crappy piece of software ever).

Another developer team that was "acqhired" by Facebook was [Acrylic Software](http://blog.acrylicapps.com/post/27635101056/our-next-project-facebook), the makers of the very amazing Pulp news app. If you were using both of their apps (Pulp and Wallet) then you are unlucky, both of their apps are now dead.

> […] there are no plans for further development on them.

Many of my favourite app developers and teams are getting swallowed by these big dogs, as much as I love Google and Facebook I hope they will put the teams in good use and release good apps.
