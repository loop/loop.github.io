I recently decided to change one from Google Account to another Google account mainly because my email address was a very childish one and felt like a idiot giving it to others, I had a second email address which was just my name which is very simple. I used Gmail's Send mail as and forward feature but it was annoying and didn't work some times so decided to make a move.

We all have one email address where it's something like **21sthardestkidinschool@gmail.com** or **ilikepieandmyself@gmail.com**, if you give out these type of email addresses to people then you are a dick and should go slap yourself.

I Googled for a good guide on how I can go transfer from Google Account to Google account but couldn't find one so decided to venture into the adventure myself and see where it takes and as it turns out it worked out fine and everything works. I will go through each of the Google Products one by one, explaining how to migrate over.

_NOTE: You will not be able to keep the current username as you are changing to a new account and Google doesn't allow you to transfer username along with your data._

**Firstly it's Picasa:**

Picasa was easy, Google already has a built in feature which allows you to a transfer all of your albums or even just selected ones, to do this:

Go to this [Google help guide](http://picasa.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=189356) and just follow those steps and it all work fine. It might take some time depending on how many photos you have but it works.

**YouTube:**

There was no easy way for this, I didn't upload any videos to my account so there was no need to reupload them again, so if you have have videos in your account then you will have to upload the again.

I had playlists so I just opened the playlist in another browser, and manually added e. to a new playlist with same name on my new account. Same goes for settings and channel customisation.

**Blogger/Blogspot:**

I used this lovely little guide and it works - [Click here](http://support.google.com/blogger/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=41448).

**Groups:**

I had to manually join all of them one by one so that sucked and also you don't get to keep your old comments or username.

**Google Calendar:**

First you have to export all of your calendars and to do that follow the second section of these instructions by Google - [Click here](http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en-GB&answer=37111&topic=1672003&ctx=topic).

After that you can import them on your new account again by using a guide by Google - [Click here](http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en-GB&answer=37118&topic=1672003&ctx=topic).

**Google Reader:**

Reader also has a import export feature but only for feeds, so your starred posts will be lost unless you do them manually but if they were really good posts you would have bookmarked them!

To transfer over your feeds, export the feeds by going to going into Google Reader, clicking the 'Gear' icon, click 'Reader Settings', click on 'Import/Export' tab, click 'Download' OMPL for the 'Your subscriptions' row.

To import go into your new Google Account, go to the same tab again, and import it by uploading, the option should be under the heading 'Import your subscriptions'.

**Google Plus:**

I didn't use Google Plus, just had a profile photo uploaded, I set the same profile pic on my new Plus account and circled the same people by just copying and pasting the people's Google+ profile link. After I did all of this, I then deleted the old Google+ profile.

This was time consuming but had to be done.

**Google Docs:**

This was easy to do. Login to you old account, select all your documents, click 'More' dropdown, select 'Download', click on 'All items' tab, and click 'Download'. A .zip file should now be downloaded onto your computer. Extract this .zip into a folder.

Login to your new account, click the upload icon, select 'Folder…', browse to the folder where the documents are stored and click 'OK'. And BOOM! It will start uploading and that is Google Docs done.

**Google Analytics:**

From your old account follow this [link](https://www.google.com/analytics/settings/user_list). Now 'Add User' this Analytics and make them 'Administrator'. Log onto your new account and go to Analytics, you should now have access to all of it like it was your old account, now go to the same link as before and remove the old account from the users.

**Google Code:**

I use Google Code for some of my scripts and it was easy to transfer to another Google Account with full access. Go to your Google Code product page, under 'Project Home' tab click people, click 'Add members' button, type in
your new email address, make them 'Owner' role. Now your new account as full access.

After you have done this for all your Google Code products, log onto your new account, go to same page and remove the old account.

**Gmail:**

This was a big one! It took me time to figure out how to go about doing this,
I tried doing the import feature from Gmail settings but Google doesn't allow Gmail to Gmail which is pretty cocked up! If they allowed this then it would have been perfect.

Now step by step.

I use a lot of filters, and there is a Gmail Lab feature which allows you to import and export Gmail filter.

Go to Gmail Labs in your account, enable the Filter import/export feature, and save your changes. Now go to the Settings -> Filters page, you've got a new Export button and a new Import link.

Export from your old account, save this file to your computer, log on to your new account and import the file. Now your filters have transferred over.

Now for the grand finale, the email. For this you will need to download [Mozilla Thunderbird](http://www.getthunderbird.com). Do the old installing new software thing you know how to do.

Add your old Gmail account and your new Gmail account (How to [here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Help_Documentation:Managing_Your_Accounts#Adding_a_new_account)). Now right click on your Inbox and click on 'Properties…', 'Synchronisation' tab, tick 'Select this folder for offline user', click 'Download Now' button, click 'OK'. Do this for all your other folders as well that you want transferred.

Wait for all your email to downloaded. Now drag and drop the email from one folder at a time into the new email account. The email will transfer to one account to another, this will take some time. Don't do anything else on the computer while this is going on as this will probably cause Thunderbird to crash. Also be aware once the email has been copied over the email copy on old account will be removed, so it is like Cut & Paste for email.

That's it! It is all done.

If I have forgotten any other Google Products please let me know and I will update to let you know how to do it!
