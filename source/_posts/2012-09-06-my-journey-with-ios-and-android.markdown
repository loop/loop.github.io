> Learning never exhausts the mind. - _Leonardo da Vinci_

A couple of months ago I my initial plan was to start learning about iOS and Android development, after a couple of weeks trying to learn the basics on Cocoa and Objective-C. I downloaded the [Stanford iOS Development](http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/ipad-iphone-application-development/id473757255) videos from iTunes U. But before I decided to watch the videos, I thought it would be best if I read up on the concepts on Objective-C so read this basic overview of it from [Cocoa Dev Central](http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec/). I got up to Lecture 4 and even managed to complete the first assignment.

After a couple of weeks decided to give it a rest as I was finding it difficult to understand and thought it is best I take a break from it to give my mind a rest. So I decided to start on Android. I did have an unfair advantage over Android as I have previous knowledge of Java, so was finding it relatively easier than iOS and was liking it more than iOS and because of this I kept going with it. I am a [spatial learner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_learning) and googled for some good videos which would benefit me, I found a series of YouTube video tutorials from [thenewboston](http://thenewboston.org/list.php?cat=6), these were brilliant (I finished these videos just a couple of days ago), they were short videos lasting around 4-7 minutes each, it goes through majority of the Android SDK which was a major plus. The only downside to the videos was that they were posted in August 2011 so the videos are taught from Honeycomb, but this downside also enabled me to learn more by researching which methods to use when they are depreciated.

That video series coupled with [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com) made learning Android so much easier.

Now, after finishing the series I hit a brick wall, I didn’t know what to build, then I remembered that somewhere on the Internet I read that the best way to keep learning how to hack stuff together is by copying other things. I decided to start copying a text to speech app, and I don’t regret that decision one bit. I’ve managed to build something basic albeit the code isn’t very great but this is the best way to learn, start from something basic and gradually start building on that. My plan is to keep continuing with this app and keep learning on how I can make it better and move on to something else when I come up with an idea on my own.

If anyone is looking into learning Android I highly recommend this combination.

My future plan is to keep on with Android and maybe look back into iOS after a year or two.
