I have decided to set my self a challenge for the next 4 months or so (while 4 months is not enough I will try my best), this challenge will be to learn 3 programming languages at once. I want to learn more than one language at once because it will help me understand different techniques and allow me to apply these techniques in order for me to solve a problem, for example if I were to get stuck on solving something in one language, while I am learning something in the other language it  might help me figure out how I can solve the initial problem. Learning these new languages will also let me build something useful which I have wanted to do for a very long time now.

I already know Java and am pretty comfortable with it but I still do search online for help. The languages which I hope to have a good understanding of by the end of the 4 months are:

**JavaScript**

[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript) is similar to Java in many ways, and will give me skills to build more dynamic websites. Learning JavaScript will also help me learn Java in a way. So anything I learn in Java will help me in JavaScript and vice versa. This will be the most straight forward language out of the 3.

**Objective-C**

Apple say that [Objective-C](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html) is a "simple computer language", I read a few blogs on Objective-C and isn't as simple as Apple might think. Even though this is a super-set of C and Java has many syntax and rules that are similar of C, this is still going to be a big step up for me but I am looking forward to this one, I have wanted to get into iOS developing for a while now.

**Ruby**

[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) where everything is an object and apparently a very elegant language with it easy to read code. Ruby also included things from languages such as Smalltalk, Java, Perl and Python. I also got told that Ruby will probably the language which I will grasp more quickly .

I will be posting my thoughts and things I have learnt in the next 4 months. In 4 months I hope to have learnt these languages to a level where I am able to understand what is happening and can develop simple applications.
