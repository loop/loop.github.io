[Facebook Is Making Us Miserable](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/12/facebook_is_making_us_miserabl.html)

This is a really interesting read and I agree with it. Facebook is slowly ruining our lives and stopping us from living to out full potential. Only reason I exist on Facbook is to keep in contact and catch up with my friends. If I could delete my Facebook I would.
