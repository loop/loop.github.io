I've been waiting for a easy jailbreak application to come and it has and it
is [JailbreakMe 3.0](http://jailbreakme.com), I upgraded my iPhone 3GS to
4.3.3, upgrade went fine then I went to jailbreakme.com, the Cydia seems to
have downloaded fine but the icon was no where to be found, in the end I had
to do a quick restore, then go to jailbreakme.com, then it jailbroke perfectly
fine. So if you get this error restore the iPhone and then jailbreak.
