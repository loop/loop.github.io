Microsoft announced their a tablet named Surface on Monday and I think it is wonderfully designed (this is how they should design all their products). The only let down of the announcement is the lack of specs information about the tablet, it was in a way an half-arsed announcement, they should have waited until everything was for certain.

The major advantage at the moment that Microsoft has is the beautiful Touch Cover. This is truly going to change the we use tablets, I'm not saying by any means that Microsoft will become dominant in the tablet market, I am saying that with a keyboard and Windows 8 you will be able to do more with the Surface than any other Tablet.

Talking about design, I think companies who design their OS should also design their own devices, only the creators can envision what it should truly look like (e.g. Apple and Microsoft now).

Apple disrupted the tablet market when they announcement the iPad and now it is time for Microsoft to show us how we can use their tablet like we use our PC desktops. The Surface is way more power than the iPad with a Intel i5 processor. [This](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-people-really-use-the-ipad-our-exclusive-survey-results-2011-5?op=1) survey by Business Insider shows that still over half the people who own the iPad still use their computer, now with Surface that number might decrease even more now that people will have similar processing power as a desktop, only time will tell though.

Everything is going the way of portability, just look at the smartphone industry. We are now using our phones for web browsing, shopping, directions or entertainment purposes, just 10 years ago we weren't even able to do it optimally on our desktops.

Microsoft have certainly caught our eyes with the announcement but in order for it to work they need to get the hardware and the software (the main thing) and the price right. For the time being even with the good looking device I am going remain skeptical about the end product.
