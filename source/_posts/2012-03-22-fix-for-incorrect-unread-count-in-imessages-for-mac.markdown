There is currently a bug on [iMessages for Mac](http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/messages-beta/) which shows incorrect count of unread messages, this bug comes and goes. There is a temporary fix while Apple corrects this with the next update (which is probably not soon).

  1. Open Terminal.
  2. Enter "**killall Dock**" (without the quote marks).
