[Outlook.com](http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2012/07/31/introducing-outlook-com-modern-email-for-the-next-billion-mailboxes.aspx)

After 15 years Microsoft have "fixed" Hotmail, or should I say Outlook. It is so much simpler and clean. Even my parents aren't confused with it anymore! Design team at Microsoft are doing their job right!

The one thing which I have found that sucks (security wise) is that apparently with Outlook, your password is limited to only 16 characters long, previously I was able to login fine with my 16+ character password!

Why the sudden change?
