In this digital world data is key and very important, there is probably not
one person who doesn't have data. Wether the data is just useless crap or
important documents and photos you still don't want to lose it. In this era I
believe that cloud is a good option, not saying it should be the only option
but having a back up in the cloud and on an external HDD is a good idea.

As I said before on a previous post I use Dropbox for all my documents, if you
look on my computer all my documents and other .txt files and PDFs are in
Dropbox. Only music and movies aren't in there.

Today I was looking for a way to backup and sync "My Pictures", I was going to
look into Dropbox but not being able to sync folders outside Dropbox folder
was not for me. Then I found SugarSync, a Dropbox competitor. Now I sync my
pictures folder with SugarSync and it is brilliant, and like Dropbox there are
apps for iPad, iPhone and Andriod. And like Dropbox if I delete a file by
accident I can recover it, deletion doesn't remove it from their servers
completely, deleted files live on the server forever and use the account
storage until your permanently delete them. It is pretty good.

Now I don't have to worry about my pictures being lost or my documents if my
computer were to crash.

I'm also looking into a place to store my code and will probably look into
Github.

Oh, before I forget every month I zip the entire contents of Dropbox folder
and copy it onto my external hard drive, you know, just in case. I will also
start doing that for my pictures as well now. :)
