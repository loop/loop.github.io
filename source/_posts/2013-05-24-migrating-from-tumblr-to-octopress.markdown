I've decided to make a move from Tumblr to static blogging using Octpress, which is hosted on GitHub pages. This gives me the oppurtunity to learn more about Ruby and git. So far I've managed to sucessfully install Octopress after coming across a load of errors. It took me about four times to have it deployed correctly.

I will fully document about the process after I sucuessfully import my Tumblr posts to here. The importing is where the headache begins.
