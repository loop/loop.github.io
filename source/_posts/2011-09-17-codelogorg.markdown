I have decided to buy the domain codelog.org to go with this blog. It seems
I'm using this quite a lot to share everything to do with code and computers.
It also seems to be attracting quite a few amount of readers and codelog.org
is a easy domain for people to remember. Why have I chosen .org? Well because
I'm providing information for free and I'm asking nothing in return and .org
just seems to fit in with this.

18/06/2012 Update: Code Log is now Finite Post.
