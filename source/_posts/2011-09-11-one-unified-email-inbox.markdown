I got really tired of having mutiple email addresses, even two was too many
for me. So I decided to redirect all email to my main email address, label
them when they reach my unified inbox and added the email address to "send as"
feature. It feels so much better now! Don't have to check every single one of
them, I have about 6 email addresses, which I know is a lot. Gmail is possibly
the best email service ever. And seeing as I all of Google Applications this
is perfect. My life is pretty much on Google Services. Might have to think
about investing in [Backupify](https://www.backupify.com/) just to make sure,
seeing Google recently had a issue where it [wiped emails of over 10000
accounts](http://www.techspot.com/news/42582-gmail-accounts-wiped-for-more-
than-100000-users.html).
