_Quick note: Before I start my blog posts on Windows 8 will be from the
perspective of a new developer who is still learning and starting university,
I have decided to throw myself in the deep end. So most of my blog posts will
be easy for a new learner to read and understand, not only Windows 8 ones but
all._

Yes I have installed Windows 8 but just reinstalled it again but it seems on
the 32-bit there isn't any tools such as Visual Basic, there isn't even
downloads to these programs separately, well there is but I have MSDN account
download the software. Decided to download 64-bit but found out it's 4.8GB
just 100mb over so I couldn't burn it onto a DVD so I had to make a bootable
USB with the OS. There are many instructions on the net on how to make a
bootable USB and most of them are pointlessly complicated and just plain
stupid. I found a much easier way.

Firstly download [Windows 7 USB/DVD Copy
Software](http://emea.microsoftstore.com/UK/en-GB/Help/Windows-7-USB-DVD-
Download-Tool). Install it and rest is just self explanatory. Locate the ISO
and choose weather to make a bootable USB or DVD. Insert into your PC and
install like you would normally install it! Very very simple!

Now I can explore Windows 8 and see how it is compared to Windows 7. I will
probably try to make simple apps using the VB developer preview but using
JavaScript and using some tutorials.
