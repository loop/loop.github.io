[Twitter Desktop Site On iPad](http://mobile.twitter.com/settings/change_ui)

It's quite annoying that on iPad, iPhone and the general mobile Twitter doesn't let you manage the follower requests. However, I have finally found a link you can go to and the Twitter desktop site is activated and it doesn't matter if you are on mobile or tablet. Finally! :-)

Title of this post is linked to the site but here it is anyway - [http://mobile.twitter.com/settings/change_ui](http://mobile.twitter.com/settings/change_ui).
