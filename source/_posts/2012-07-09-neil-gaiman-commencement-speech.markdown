This commencement speech by Neil Gaiman at [UArts](http://www.uarts.edu/) (_every university website should be well designed as UArts website)_ is probably the next best one after the Steve Jobs [one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA). He is an amazing author and artist, he was responsible for one of the most amazing comic books [The Sandman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(Vertigo))Â which is on par with Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns.

If you are an artist of any kind (I consider coding as art!) you need to watch this, it is truly inspiring.

> Make interesting mistakes, make amazing mistakes, make glorious and fantastic mistakes. Break rules. Leave the world more interesting for you being here.

> Make. Good. Art.
