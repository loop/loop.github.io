[We are not ready for MacBook Pro with Retina Display](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/06/macbook-pro-with-retina-display-gives-apple-a-1-year-lead-on-ultrabooks/)

Yesterday at WWDC Apple announced the "the most _amazing_ computer we have ever made" the [MacBook Pro with Retina Display](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/features/).

> Appleâ€™s next-generation MacBook Pro is about as thin as a MacBook Air, as fast as high-end desktop computers, and features the highest-resolution notebook screen ever made. And, according to industry analysts, the new notebook pushes Apple at least a year ahead of the best competing ultrabooks and high-end PC notebooks.

I have to highly disagree with this, even though the hardware and the software Apple made for their computers are amazing, this Retina Display is going to be bad, and I mean really bad.

If you have the new iPad you can see as you browse, some of the websites looks blurry and pretty pixelated. And this is what you are going to be seeing on the Retina Display as well, the web just isn't ready for high resolution images. With high resolution images there comes large file sizes which means websites will take longer for people to load and will also eat up more bandwidth, while this is not that big much of a problem it is still a problem, and I think Apple sees this as well. This is probably why they have only released one notebook with Retina Display technology.

Apple has brought this out way too soon, and we just aren't ready yet. Maybe in 2 years time (or even more)!

**P.S.** It would be pretty awesome if you followed me on Twitter, [here](http://twitter.com/finitepost).
