I think there is a big need for a device made specifically for Spotify, I know
you can use it on your Andriod and iOS devices but having a device which is
just for Spotify would be brilliant. It would be much cheaper for the user as
well.

My idea is that a premium Spotify user can have the option of buying a Spotify
Device when they buy their subscription. This device would be really simple,
only have Wi-Fi (but could also have Wi-Fi + 3G, like the Amazon Kindle), and
be touchscreen or to keep the costs down simple buttons.

I recently bought Spotify Premium and the app on my Android works fine but the
battery issue is what I don't like, it doesn't drain it but I listen to music
a lot and I will use up battery a lot, having a Spotify Device would be simple
and save a lot of battery on your mobile device.
