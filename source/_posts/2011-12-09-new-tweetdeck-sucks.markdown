[TweetDeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com/), now owned by Twitter finally came out of beta an released version 1.0 on Thursday 8th December at the same time that Twitter announced [Fly](http://fly.twitter.com/), the next step for Twitter.

They completely overhalued TweetDeck getting rid of AIR and have a native application for both Mac OS X and Windows.

Apparently according to TweetDeck it "_is an app that brings more flexibility and insight to power users_".

Well that is just bullshit, it is completely shit. I will do a follow up post on why it is shit soon.

I prematurely uninstalled TweetDeck .air so I could install TweetDeck 1.0 which was a very wrong thing to do. I had trouble finding the latest .air so I could install it again but in the end I found it.

Here is the .air for anyone who wishes to install it back and use this simple and fast application without any of the crap.
