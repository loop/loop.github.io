[Everything About App.net](http://www.orianmarx.com/2012/08/13/how-app-net-can-change-everything/)

I didn't really take much notice of this App.net platform that Dalton Cladwell aims to [build](http://daltoncaldwell.com/an-audacious-proposal),  even though there are numerous amount of tweets on my timeline every other day and just yesterday the project got fully funded at $500k.

This article titled "How App.net Can Change Everything" by [Orian Marx](http://www.twitter.com/Orian) really explains everything and is well worth a read. It isn't just his opinions but information from many different sources as well.
