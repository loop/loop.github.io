This is something really awesome which I came across on [HackerNews](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3469692), it is a way to logon to your Google Account without typing in your google credentials.

There are millions of accounts on Google, no one is sure as to the exact amount but comScore says that there are 1 millions unique visitors to Google worldwide. This means terabytes of data that Google has, data which is personal or even work secrets.

Imagine using a public computer, you don't know who was on it before, you don't know what kind of hidden crapware is installed, you don't know if a keylogger is hidden somewhere. This is where this (new) feature can save you so your keystrokes aren't logged.

  1. On a browser go to [[https://accounts.google.com/sesame](https://accounts.google.com/sesame)](https://accounts.google.com/sesame) (Do NOT close this yet.)
  2. Using a QR Scanner app on your phone scan it and it should direct you to a page where it asks you if you want to be taken to Gmail or iGoogle. Choose which one you want.
  3. Now if you go back to the browser where the QR page is open, it should have now redirected to either Gmail or iGoogle depending on what you chose.

This is a pretty nifty feature.

_UPDATE: Google has pulled this feature, while this was a nice little feature. The reason they presented was:_

> _Hi there – thanks for your interest in our phone-based login experiment.While we have concluded this particular experiment, we constantly experiment with new and more secure authentication mechanisms._
>
> _Stay tuned for something even better!_
