About The Author
-----------------
~~Finite Post is written by myself, Yogesh Nagarur.~~ This is not called Finite Post but these words are still my own.

I'm currently a Computer Science undergrad at [King's College London](http://www.kcl.ac.uk) and have studied for a year at [University of California, Santa Barbara](http://ucsb.edu). I've had a keen fascination with everything to do with technology, design and in particular, code. This place is where I share my thoughts and talk about anything releated to my interests. You can also check out some my Open Source projects on my GitHub [profile](https://github.com/loop).
