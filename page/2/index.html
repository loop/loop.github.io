  <div class="entry-content"><p>After 15 years Microsoft have &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; Hotmail, or should I say Outlook. It is so much simpler and clean. Even my parents aren&rsquo;t confused with it anymore! Design team at Microsoft are doing their job right!</p>

<p>The one thing which I have found that sucks (security wise) is that apparently with Outlook, your password is limited to only 16 characters long, previously I was able to login fine with my 16+ character password!</p>

<p>Why the sudden change?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As much as I love Finder I just find navigating multiple windows of Finder really cumbersome. I found TotalFinder which is pretty sweet, it isn&rsquo;t an additional app, it extends Finder. It basically turns Finder into The Hulk and CPU usage is same as Finder which is a big plus. There are many alternative Finders but this one is the best one out there and for a lovely price!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday 2 amazing teams were hired by the big boys. <a href="http://sparrowmailapp.com/">Sparrow</a> was acquired by Google for under <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/20/3172365/sources-google-sparrow-25-million-gmail-client/in/2936538">$25 Million</a>. Sparrow is the best mail client out there, it is so simple and just works. It is such a shame that the development of Sparrow will cease and no new features will be added to their mail clients. Hopefully the team and Google can work together to bring a more awesome mail client.</p>

<blockquote><p>We will continue to make available our existing products, and we will provide support and critical updates to our users. However, as we’ll be busy with new projects at Google, we do not plan to release new features for the Sparrow apps.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can&rsquo;t say that I am surprised about this acquisition, Google&rsquo;s initial release of their GMail app for iOS really sucked and in my opinion still sucks.</p>

<p>I guess it is back to Apple Mail (which is the most crappy piece of software ever).</p>

<p>Another developer team that was &ldquo;acqhired&rdquo; by Facebook was <a href="http://blog.acrylicapps.com/post/27635101056/our-next-project-facebook">Acrylic Software</a>, the makers of the very amazing Pulp news app. If you were using both of their apps (Pulp and Wallet) then you are unlucky, both of their apps are now dead.</p>

<blockquote><p>[…] there are no plans for further development on them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many of my favourite app developers and teams are getting swallowed by these big dogs, as much as I love Google and Facebook I hope they will put the teams in good use and release good apps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This commencement speech by Neil Gaiman at <a href="http://www.uarts.edu/">UArts</a> (<em>every university website should be well designed as UArts website)</em> is probably the next best one after the Steve Jobs <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA">one</a>. He is an amazing author and artist, he was responsible for one of the most amazing comic books <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(Vertigo">The Sandman</a>) which is on par with Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns.</p>

<p>If you are an artist of any kind (I consider coding as art!) you need to watch this, it is truly inspiring.</p>

<p>The concept of &lsquo;promising a future&rsquo; is brilliant, this is what technology should be doing and this is why it works.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Microsoft announced their a tablet named Surface on Monday and I think it is wonderfully designed (this is how they should design all their products). The only let down of the announcement is the lack of specs information about the tablet, it was in a way an half-arsed announcement, they should have waited until everything was for certain.</p>

<p>The major advantage at the moment that Microsoft has is the beautiful Touch Cover. This is truly going to change the we use tablets, I&rsquo;m not saying by any means that Microsoft will become dominant in the tablet market, I am saying that with a keyboard and Windows 8 you will be able to do more with the Surface than any other Tablet.</p>

<p>Talking about design, I think companies who design their OS should also design their own devices, only the creators can envision what it should truly look like (e.g. Apple and Microsoft now).</p>

<p>Apple disrupted the tablet market when they announcement the iPad and now it is time for Microsoft to show us how we can use their tablet like we use our PC desktops. The Surface is way more power than the iPad with a Intel i5 processor. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-people-really-use-the-ipad-our-exclusive-survey-results-2011-5?op=1">This</a> survey by Business Insider shows that still over half the people who own the iPad still use their computer, now with Surface that number might decrease even more now that people will have similar processing power as a desktop, only time will tell though.</p>

<p>Everything is going the way of portability, just look at the smartphone industry. We are now using our phones for web browsing, shopping, directions or entertainment purposes, just 10 years ago we weren&rsquo;t even able to do it optimally on our desktops.</p>

<p>Microsoft have certainly caught our eyes with the announcement but in order for it to work they need to get the hardware and the software (the main thing) and the price right. For the time being even with the good looking device I am going remain skeptical about the end product.</p>
