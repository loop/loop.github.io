  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve decided to make a move from Tumblr to static blogging using Octpress, which is hosted on GitHub pages. This gives me the oppurtunity to learn more about Ruby and git. So far I&rsquo;ve managed to sucessfully install Octopress after coming across a load of errors. It took me about four times to have it deployed correctly.</p>

<p>I will fully document about the process after I sucuessfully import my Tumblr posts to here. The importing is where the headache begins.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>Learning never exhausts the mind. &ndash; <em>Leonardo da Vinci</em></p></blockquote>

<p>A couple of months ago I my initial plan was to start learning about iOS and Android development, after a couple of weeks trying to learn the basics on Cocoa and Objective-C. I downloaded the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/ipad-iphone-application-development/id473757255">Stanford iOS Development</a> videos from iTunes U. But before I decided to watch the videos, I thought it would be best if I read up on the concepts on Objective-C so read this basic overview of it from <a href="http://cocoadevcentral.com/d/learn_objectivec/">Cocoa Dev Central</a>. I got up to Lecture 4 and even managed to complete the first assignment.</p>

<p>After a couple of weeks decided to give it a rest as I was finding it difficult to understand and thought it is best I take a break from it to give my mind a rest. So I decided to start on Android. I did have an unfair advantage over Android as I have previous knowledge of Java, so was finding it relatively easier than iOS and was liking it more than iOS and because of this I kept going with it. I am a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_learning">spatial learner</a> and googled for some good videos which would benefit me, I found a series of YouTube video tutorials from <a href="http://thenewboston.org/list.php?cat=6">thenewboston</a>, these were brilliant (I finished these videos just a couple of days ago), they were short videos lasting around 4-7 minutes each, it goes through majority of the Android SDK which was a major plus. The only downside to the videos was that they were posted in August 2011 so the videos are taught from Honeycomb, but this downside also enabled me to learn more by researching which methods to use when they are depreciated.</p>

<p>That video series coupled with <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> made learning Android so much easier.</p>

<p>Now, after finishing the series I hit a brick wall, I didn’t know what to build, then I remembered that somewhere on the Internet I read that the best way to keep learning how to hack stuff together is by copying other things. I decided to start copying a text to speech app, and I don’t regret that decision one bit. I’ve managed to build something basic albeit the code isn’t very great but this is the best way to learn, start from something basic and gradually start building on that. My plan is to keep continuing with this app and keep learning on how I can make it better and move on to something else when I come up with an idea on my own.</p>

<p>If anyone is looking into learning Android I highly recommend this combination.</p>

<p>My future plan is to keep on with Android and maybe look back into iOS after a year or two.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There have been lots of <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/smartphones/androids-apps-are-comparatively-ugly-is-linux-to-blame/3601">blog</a><a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/04/easier-design-apps-ios/">posts</a>, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/why-android-apps-ugly-164400290.html">articles</a> in the news and <a href="http://www.talkandroid.com/android-forums/android-chat/4483-why-general-ui-most-android-apps-ugly.html">discussions</a> on why apps look <strong>so</strong> much better on iOS than they do on Android. The problem with these articles is that they go straight to the software and blame it, they simply say &ldquo;because iOS is better&rdquo;, I believe this is not the case. Android is not the problem, Android developers are the cause, they think just because it is easy to publish on the Play Store and make money they don&rsquo;t have to care about how their apps look. They simply throw on some shitty design they do in about an hour or two and say that&rsquo;s fine, let&rsquo;s make my self rich.</p>

<p>There are many apps which look amazing, and the commonality between these apps is that they follow the <a href="http://developer.android.com/design/index.html">Android Design Guidelines</a>. Below are screenshots[1] just some of my favourite good designed apps from Android (TED, Foursquare and FlightTrack) :</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m95l3pzyAN1qamsz8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m95l6nLqS31qamsz8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m95l58Z0yi1qamsz8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The above screenshots show just how good looking the apps can be, if the developers just took some timeout and focused on designing it, and as you can see they follow the guidelines set by Google.</p>

<p>I just want Google to start looking at how many ugly apps there are in their Play Store and start enforcing developers to follow their guidelines and design better looks apps.</p>

<p>I am aware that Apple makes it easier to design good looking apps because of their Xcode and that for Android it is more time consuming (due to fragmentation) and is a big harder but in this century it is all about how good looking things are, if it looks crap then chances are you will be missing out on many sales/downloads.</p>

<p>I also want developers to focus their apps for Android OS 2.3+, and also the recent study on fragmentation of Android shows that HTC and Samsung are the winners and &ldquo;Testing on the most popular Samsung &amp; HTC devices will get you along way&rdquo;[2].</p>

<p>Just as a side note, I wish developers would stop just porting their iOS designed app to Android, that is not how it is supposed to be done. They are two different OS with many differences. One of the culprits is Instagram, they have 99% copied their iOS design to Android. If they followed the guidelines and designed for Android from ground up this is how good it can look[3]:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m95n5rDC3l1qamsz8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>So Android developers, go forth and focus on design as much are you are focusing on the code.</p>

<ol>
<li> The screenshots are taken from <a href="http://androidniceties.tumblr.com">Android niceties</a> blog, this blog highlights the best looking Android apps and worth browsing for inspiration.</li>
<li> OpenSignalMaps done a <a href="http://opensignalmaps.com/reports/fragmentation.php">study</a> on the fragmentation of the Android market back in May.</li>
<li> This was designed by <a href="http://www.theverge.com/users/snalty">snalty</a> and posted on <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/7/23/3179989/holo-instagram">The Verge forums</a> showing how it would have looked like if they followed the Android design principles.</li>
</ol>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday while I was cleaning out my online accounts, deleted accounts and things I came across my <a href="https://photocard.tfl.gov.uk">Photocard</a> login from Transport for London, I couldn&rsquo;t remember what this account was for so I decided to login, weirdly it said my password was incorrect, but this would have been impossible for me (unless I got hacked) because I use 1Password to generate random passwords and always store them in the app. Thinking I might have made a mistake when I saved it, I decided to do the good old &ldquo;Forgot your password&rdquo; procedure, entered my email and everything, and then I got the email.</p>

<p>When I got the email, I was amazed to see that it wasn&rsquo;t a link to reset my password but an actually password, I then decided to compare the password in the email and the password I saved in 1Password and then I was shocked to see that they actually emailed me my password.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m92ahhRh6K1qamsz8.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Now, you might be wondering if they emailed me my password why wasn&rsquo;t I able to login? Let me explain, 99% of my passwords at 16 characters, when I signed up to TfL photocard I created a 16 character password (it didn&rsquo;t give me an error saying it has to less than 16 characters). But the password they emailed me was 10 characters, they truncated my 16 characters password to 10. How can this be possible?</p>

<p>I decided to Google around to see how I can find out if passwords are being stored in plaintext, I came across this question on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/701801/how-to-tell-if-a-site-stores-passwords-in-plain-text">Stackoverflow</a>.</p>

<p>I read through all of the answers and comparing how TfL gave me my password:</p>

<ol>
<li> They managed to cut down my 16 character password to 10 and this is only possible if they stored it in plaintext I reckon.</li>
<li> They emailed me my password in plaintext.</li>
</ol>


<p>I am aware that this might not been they are stored in plaintext but these are very bad security practices for a <strong>government body.</strong></p>

<p>Also TfL has multiple &ldquo;minisites&rdquo; which require a login, and I&rsquo;m not 100% if this is the care for all of them or just this one. But, even if it is this one it is still a shambles because it contains my personal details.</p>

<p>NOTE: I&rsquo;m not 100% sure that they are storing it in plaintext but the way the are sending me my password and somehow managed to update my passwords shows hints they might be and their security practices sucks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After 15 years Microsoft have &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; Hotmail, or should I say Outlook. It is so much simpler and clean. Even my parents aren&rsquo;t confused with it anymore! Design team at Microsoft are doing their job right!</p>

<p>The one thing which I have found that sucks (security wise) is that apparently with Outlook, your password is limited to only 16 characters long, previously I was able to login fine with my 16+ character password!</p>

<p>Why the sudden change?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As much as I love Finder I just find navigating multiple windows of Finder really cumbersome. I found TotalFinder which is pretty sweet, it isn&rsquo;t an additional app, it extends Finder. It basically turns Finder into The Hulk and CPU usage is same as Finder which is a big plus. There are many alternative Finders but this one is the best one out there and for a lovely price!</p>
