<div class="entry-content"><p>Firstly let me just say that the title maybe a little misleading, I haven&rsquo;t
completely moved to the cloud yet, the majority of the things I do on my
computer are done on the Cloud as well as the storage of my data.</p>

<p>Firstly for my files, I use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>, I know there
has been a lot of rumours that Dropbox can look at our data well that is just
pure bullshit, plus if I had any sensitive information I encrypt it then copy
it to my Dropbox folder, Dropbox is one of the best Cloud services I have ever
used, I really don&rsquo;t know what I would do without it, it pretty much has all
my documents, my project files (Once a project has been finished I copy it to
my external HD).</p>

<p>Dropbox also come into play for my password management, I use a different
password on every single site, I&rsquo;m very security conscious now, I think the
recent hacking teach us a lesson about password management, for example if I
find out that one of the password dumps had my login to the password I don&rsquo;t
have to have sleepless nights of worrying about my 100&rsquo;s of other accounts
because I&rsquo;m using a completely unique password for each website. Because I use
a different password for each site it is important to me that I have all this
data synchronized across all my device, I have an iPhone and a Windows PC, so
I choose 1Password, with <a href="http://agilebits.com/products/1Password">1Password</a>
it has been heaven managing all my passwords, one of the useful features of
1Password is it&rsquo;s ability to sync my password files and other secure notes
using Dropbox. Also 1Password uses AES Encryption Using OpenSSL, (go
<a href="http://help.agilebits.com/1Password/agile_keychain_design.html">here</a> for
more info).</p>

<p>For my bookmarks, I used to use <a href="http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?answer=185277">Google Chrome
sync</a> option
but then I realised that if I go on a computer I wouldn&rsquo;t be connected to my
computer so I turned to <a href="http://pinboard.in">Pinboard</a>, I use two extensions
on Chrome, one is called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webst%0Aore/detail/geblijjkhblgfjmoldempogloilbfnkk">Pinboard For Chrome</a> and <a href="https://chrome.goo%0Agle.com/webstore/detail/nfccdohlgojifgadgnbjoejdfaalaehn">Pinboard</a>. Even though you
have to pay for it, it is a very good service and I have my bookmarks where
ever I go. It is really worth it.</p>

<p>For my email and calendar I use <a href="http://www.google.com/about/">Google
services</a>, for email I do something very
special, because I have more than few email addresses it is a big hassle to
check email one everyday, so what I do is forward all the email to my main
@gmail.com address, and use the &lsquo;send as…&rsquo; feature so I can send email as
other addresses depending on which email it was sent to first. Google
automatically sets this for you so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it.</p>

<p>I also use <a href="http://google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a>, this way I can
access what I have to be and where I have to be from anywhere I wish, Google
has become my personal assistant.</p>

<p>For photos I use <a href="http://google.com/picasa">Google Picasa</a>, the main reason I
use this is because my family lives on different parts of the Earth and now
that everyone of them are connected to the Internet, I can simply email them a
secret link which gives them accesses to a specific album. I don&rsquo;t yet use
anything for videos as I don&rsquo;t take videos just photos, but if I had to choose
a cloud service for videos, I would choose <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a>, once
again it has the secret link feature and it is owned by Google. I trust Google
a lot because I don&rsquo;t see them going out of business and I don&rsquo;t think hackers
would mess with Google.</p>

<p>For notes I use 2 things, first one is <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a>, it is
available to me on all the platforms I use, but thing I found was that it is
slow for me on the iPhone so I use an app on the iPhone called
&lsquo;<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elements-dropbox-powered-%0Atext/id382752422?mt=8">Elements</a>&rsquo;, I use elements if I need to write down a very quick
note, it uses Dropbox as a syncing medium and creates .txt files which are
readable on all platforms.</p>

<p>For my to-do list I use a wunderful (Sorry, bad joke) thing called
<a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/">Wunderlist</a>, I love it! I can use it on Windows,
Mac, iOS and Andriod! Even though I only have iOS and Windows. The syncing is
beautiful and have all my tasks in folders and everything. Really useful and
now never forget to do anything.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t currently use anything for my music or films as I have a lot of it and
haven&rsquo;t found a service I like, if you have a suggestion please leave a
comment below.</p>

<p>Nor am I using any cloud service for documents and such, but in the future I
will be turning to Google again and using <a href="http://google.com/documents">Google
Docs</a> as once again I can use it on any platform
I wish.</p>

<p>If you use any cloud services let me know and I will check them out. The main
things I look for in a cloud service is reliability, security and platform
compatibility, I don&rsquo;t want a service which I can use on platform, who the
hell would want that?</p>

<p><em>Note: Monthly I take a backup of my Dropbox and Pinboard as I feel like it is
a nice thing to do and if for some reason the servers go down due to
datacenter problem, I don&rsquo;t have to worry as I have a backup.</em></p>
